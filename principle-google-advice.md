Your code is generally well-structured and follows some good practices. Here are some suggestions for improvement, considering industry standards and best practices:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Use a more descriptive name for your environment variables. For example, `DB_LOCALHOST` could be `DB_HOST`.
   - Consider using a library like `python-decouple` or `python-dotenv` for managing environment variables.

2. **Database Connection:**
   - Wrap your database connection and cursor in a context manager to ensure they are properly closed. You can use `with` statements or create a custom context manager.
   - Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like SQLAlchemy for more Pythonic interactions with your database.

3. **Constants:**
   - Define constants like `max_len` at the beginning of your script using uppercase names to indicate they are constants. This makes it easier to find and modify them.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement proper error handling for database connections and queries. Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and log or handle them appropriately.

5. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - Consider splitting your code into smaller functions for better readability and maintainability.
   - Move the database-related code into a separate module or class to encapsulate the database logic.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Add comments or docstrings to explain the purpose and functionality of your functions and blocks of code.

7. **Code Formatting:**
   - Use consistent indentation throughout your code. PEP 8 recommends using 4 spaces for each level of indentation.
   - Ensure there are two blank lines before a function or class definition.

8. **Bot Prefix:**
   - Instead of hardcoding the bot prefix, consider fetching it dynamically from the bot instance. This makes it easier to change the prefix if needed.

9. **Event Listeners:**
   - Consider adding more event listeners to handle different events, making your bot more versatile.

10. **Handle Command Errors:**
    - Implement a `on_command_error` event listener to handle errors that occur during command execution.

Remember, these are suggestions, and the best practices may vary based on the specific needs and requirements of your project.
